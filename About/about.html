            <p>
              <span>
                Netmetric Indian Of Information Technology Limited is a globally
                recognized IT education and training company. We are registered
                with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) under the RC:
                1207813. Our core business focuses on providing Information
                Technology (IT) services, consulting, human capital development,
                and capacity building.
              </span>

              <span>
                Since the late 2012s, we have made significant investments in
                ICT infrastructure in schools and have provided ICT training for
                teachers and other professionals. However, there has been
                limited national research evidence on the impact of this new
                technology on teaching and learning in schools.
              </span>

              <span>
                We take pride in being the initiator of the ICT4ALL Solution,
                which is dedicated to empowering children through ICT and
                capacity building. As a lead consulting partner, we collaborate
                with international, local, corporate, ICT organizations,
                institutions, associations, and societies to develop ICT
                education and manage innovations.
              </span>

              <span>
                As a socially responsible firm, we strongly believe that the
                social impact resulting from problem-solving is a major measure
                of business success. That's why we actively create solutions to
                social and economic problems within our immediate society
                through public and private partnership projects (PPP).
              </span>

              <span>
                At Netmetric, our primary focus is to analyze the contemporary
                Nigerian society, identify problematic areas across all levels
                of the economy, and propose holistic solutions based on ICT
                development and appropriate software solutions. Our guiding
                principle is "what is new and what is next" to effectively
                address present and future challenges in the field of ICT
