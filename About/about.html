          <h2>Who are We?</h2>
          <p>
            Netmetric Indian Of Information Technology Limited is a globally
            recognized IT education and training company. We are registered with
            the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) under the RC: 1207813. Our
            core business focuses on providing Information Technology (IT)
            services, consulting, human capital development, and capacity
            building.<br />

            Since the late 2012s, we have made significant investments in ICT
            infrastructure in schools and have provided ICT training for
            teachers and other professionals. However, there has been limited
            national research evidence on the impact of this new technology on
            teaching and learning in schools. <br />

            We take pride in being the initiator of the ICT4ALL Solution, which
            is dedicated to empowering children through ICT and capacity
            building. As a lead consulting partner, we collaborate with
            international, local, corporate, ICT organizations, institutions,
            associations, and societies to develop ICT education and manage
            innovations. <br />

            As a socially responsible firm, we strongly believe that the social
            impact resulting from problem-solving is a major measure of business
            success. That's why we actively create solutions to social and
            economic problems within our immediate society through public and
            private partnership projects (PPP). <br />

            At Netmetric, our primary focus is to analyze the contemporary
            Nigerian society, identify problematic areas across all levels of
            the economy, and propose holistic solutions based on ICT development
            and appropriate software solutions. Our guiding principle is "what
            is new and what is next" to effectively address present and future
            challenges in the field of ICT
